# About the game
This game is made with the intention to be the capstone project for my Software Design and Development course. In this game I explore graphics APIs and learn how to create a game from scratch in OpenGL.

## Credits
This game takes heavy inspiration from Genshin Impact's event-limited game Paper Theatre.
